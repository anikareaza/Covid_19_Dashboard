# Project Overview
This end-to-end project explored global COVID-19 case and mortality data across continents using Python, SQL, and Tableau. The goal was to uncover disparities in infection rates, mortality patterns, and regional trends to support public health decision-making through interactive data visualizations.
Created a COVID-19 Analysis Dashboard utilizing SQL for data management and Tableau for visualization.

# Executive Summary
This project analyzed over 150,000 COVID-19 case records across continents to explore infection and mortality patterns. Data was transformed using SQL and Python, and insights were visualized using a Tableau dashboard. The analysis revealed that North and South America accounted for 62% of global COVID-19 deaths, with mortality in North America nearly 50× higher than in Oceania. Key findings informed region-specific health responses and showed the value of dynamic, data-driven storytelling in public health.

# Overview of Findings
- Mortality Disparities: North and South America combined contributed to over 62% of global deaths.

- Continental Trends: North America’s death count was disproportionately higher than other regions.

- Country-Level Insights: Canada and the U.S. showed distinct spikes during specific phases of the pandemic.

- Public Health Visualization: Tableau dashboards enabled filtering by country and timeframe, promoting accessible health intelligence for policymakers and the public.

# Key Discoveries & Methods
-Data Collection & Cleaning: Parsed and cleaned 150k+ rows of raw COVID-19 case data using Python and SQL, handling missing values, inconsistent formats, and outliers.

-Data Transformation: Calculated continent-level death percentages, total cases, and infection rates using SQL queries and DataFrame operations.

-Statistical Analysis: Identified critical insights such as:

  -North and South America accounted for 62% of global COVID-19 deaths.

  -North America’s death count was ~50x higher than Oceania.

  -Continent mortality and infection rates are visualized to reveal trends over time.

-Time-Series Analysis: Tracked average percent population infected per country from 2020 to 2025 to show infection progression.

-Dashboard Development: Created an interactive Tableau dashboard with:

  -Global numbers summary

  -Deaths per continent

  -Interactive map (country-level infection rates)

  -Time-series charts for selected countries
